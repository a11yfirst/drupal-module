## Link

### How it works

* When the *Link* button is activated, the *Link* dialog is displayed with
the focus set to the *URL* field. If a text selection was previously made,
the *Display Text* field is populated with the selected text.

* However, if you activate the *Link* button with an empty selection, the
default behavior is to use the *URL* text as the *Display Text*. This is
problematic because URLs are often not very descriptive.

### About display text

* The *Display Text* for a link should be descriptive, unique and start with
keywords (NNG).

* The *Display Text* must **not** be empty, since it results in the URL being
used as the display text for the link.

* The *Display Text* must **not** use ambiguous text, for example "Click Here"
or "More".

* The *Display Text* for links is like a sign post. It should tell you what
youâ€™ll find when you follow it (NOMENSA).

* Be consistent: Links to the same URL should have the same *Display Text*.

### Why it's important

* Descriptive link text makes it easier for everyone to find and follow links
on a page that are of interest to them.

* Descriptive link text is especially important for people using screen
readers, who typically only hear the display text spoken to them through speech
synthesis and do not "see" the link in the context of other content on the page.

* When URLs or ambiguous text are used as the display text for a link, it is
impossible in many cases, and much more difficult in the remaining cases, for
screen reader users to find and follow links of interest to them.
