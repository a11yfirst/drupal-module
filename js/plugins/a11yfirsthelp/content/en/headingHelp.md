## Heading

### How it works
* The Heading menu only enables the **allowed** heading levels.

* The cursor position relative to other headings in the document determines
which heading levels are allowed.

* To create a new heading, move the cursor to a text block and select an
allowed heading level.

* To convert a heading to normal text, move the cursor to a heading and select
the *Normal text* option.

### Why it's important
* The purpose of a heading is to label the content that follows it.

* The proper nesting of heading levels improves the ability of all users to
find and read information on a page.

* Headings used consistently and in meaningful ways improve Search Engine
Optimization (SEO).

* Properly nested headings enable people using assistive technologies to easily
navigate to each section of a document.

### More information
* Documents are easier to read and understand when headings identify the topics
they contain.

* Headings make it easier to scan and find topics of interest within a document.

* Heading levels identify the structural relationships between sections of
content in a document.

* Higher-level headings (Levels 1 and 2) identify the main topics of a document
and lower-level headings (Levels 3, 4, 5 and 6) identify subsections of the
document.

* A subsection is identified by using the next lower-level heading. For
example, subsections of Level 2 headings use Level 3 headings, subsections of
Level 3 headings use Level 4 headings, and so on to Level 6 headings.

* Break content into subsections when there are two or more ideas or concepts
that correspond to the topics covered in the section. Use headings of the same
level to label each subsection.

* Heading levels should **never** be used for inline visual styling of content
(e.g. larger or smaller font size, bold or italic). Instead, use the `Inline
Style` options.
